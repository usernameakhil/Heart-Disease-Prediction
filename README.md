#  Bayesian Network for Medical Diagnosis

This project builds and visualizes a **Bayesian Network** using Python libraries like `pgmpy`, `networkx`, and `matplotlib`. The model captures probabilistic relationships between medical features such as age, cholesterol, heart rate, etc., and a `target` variable indicating potential disease.

##  Features

- Define a Bayesian structure manually
- Visualize the graph using `networkx`
- (Optional) Extend for inference and CPD learning using real data
